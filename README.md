Nodecopter remote
=================

Little project, that uses an arduino board hooked up with a bunch of sensors
to remote control a drone. Think: flex sensor controlling speed, button to 
take off, land, potentiometer to adjust height, etc.

This is all very experimental, but good fun :)

All with node.js <3
